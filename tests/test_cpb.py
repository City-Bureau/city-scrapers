Prior sign-up is required of those wishing to address the Board; contact the Board's office by 4:30 p.m. of the day before the meeting to add your name to the list of speakers. See below for the dates of the regular monthly meetings. Unless otherwise noted, the meetings are on the third Thursday of the month, are scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m., and take place at Chicago Public Safety Headquarters, 3510 South Michigan Avenue. Also appearing below are links to the transcripts of the meetings and the material made available at the meeting--the \"Blue Book\" that includes the meeting agenda, minutes, statistics on disciplinary matters, and a list of CPD directives issued by the Superintendent.")
