"""
ChiSsa4Spider can't be tested in the typical way because it does POST
responses to get meeting data.  I'm unsure what would be best practice
to make it testable. IMO the ideal solution would be to test the scraper
with a live response from the server, as it is actually formulated by Scrapy,
instead of an offline file response. I don't know the most natural way to do
that though. Another potential solution would be to mock the POST response.
