# Documenters Aggregator

The Documenters Aggregator a collection of scrapers and utilities to collect and store a comprehensive, central, and accessible calendar for public government meetings in Chicago and Cook County.

## Use Case

Public meetings are important spaces for democracy where any resident can participate and hold public figures accountable. [City Bureau's Documenters program](https://www.citybureau.org/documenters) pays community members an hourly wage to inform and engage their communities by attending and documenting public meetings.

How does the Documenters program know when meetings are happening? It isn’t easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.

That’s why City Bureau and ProPublica Illinois worked together with a team of civic coders to develop and coordinate a community open source project to scrape and store these meetings in a central Documenters calendar.

## Coding Community

Documenters Aggregator is a community-based open source project with a friendly community that welcomes contributions from everyone.
