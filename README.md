# Documenters Aggregator

The Documenters Aggregator a collection of scrapers and utilities to collect and store a comprehensive, central, and accessible calendar for public government meetings in Chicago and Cook County.

This project is designed to aid [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/)'s [Documenters](http://www.citybureau.org/documenters/) program in identifying public meetings, assigning people to document them, and capturing notes and information about the meetings.

Documenters Aggregator is a community-based open source project with a friendly community that welcomes contributions from everyone.
