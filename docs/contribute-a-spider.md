# Contributing a spider

## Find a site to scrape and create an issue

First, find an unclaimed event source in the [spreadsheet of event sources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L1lbWj89wt8b2DIZhjxERJ5FCAWPDWd0nMibtc01sZk/edit#gid=0). Any scraper with a status of "needs evaluation" is fair game. If someone has already claimed the scraper, talk with them about joining their efforts.

Assuming you picked out a new one, create a [new issue](https://github.com/City-Bureau/documenters-aggregator/issues/new) with a title like "SPIDER: [name of agency]". Name of agency should be a fairly full name. "Chicago Housing Authority" is preferred over "CHA" in the issue title.

Save and note the issue number.

## Create a new branch

Create a new branch in your fork:

```
git checkout -b XXXX-spider-NAMEOFAGENCY
```

`XXXX` is the zero-padded issue number and `NAMEOFAGENCY` should be something like `cha`. For example, for ticket number 53 entitled "SPIDER: Chicago Housing Authority", create a branch named `0053-spider-cha`.

## Create a spider

Run the `genspider` task with a spider name and domain to scrape. Following the previous example:

```
invoke genspider cha www.thecha.org
```

You should see some output like:

```
Created /Users/eads/projects/documenters-aggregator/documenters_aggregator/spiders/cha.py
Created /Users/eads/projects/documenters-aggregator/tests/test_cha.py
```

If you would also like to download some pages for local testing, run:

```
invoke genspider cha www.thecha.org -s=http://www.thecha.org/events/property_damage_prevention_and_clean-u-9-6-2017,http://www.thecha.org/events/property_management_business_basic-9-13-2017
```

This will download the two sites passed to the `-s` parameter and save them as html files in `tests/files`.


## Test crawling

You now have a spider named `cha`. To run it (admittedly, not much will happen until you start editing the scraper), run:

```
scrapy crawl cha
```

## Run the automated tests

We use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) testing framework to
verify the behavior of the project's code and 
[pyflakes](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) to
check that all code is written in the proper style.

To run these tools, use the `invoke runtests` command:

```
invoke runtests
```

Whoops! The tests fail by default. Here's typical output:

```

```

That's OK. Once you have passing tests, you can make a pull request.

## Write parse methods in the spider

Open `documenters_aggregator/spiders/cha.py` to work on your spider. A simple structure has been
created for you to use. Let's look at the basics and discuss advanced uses later.

The spider should look something like this:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
All spiders should yield data shaped according to the Open Civic Data
specification (http://docs.opencivicdata.org/en/latest/data/event.html).
"""
import scrapy

from datetime import datetime


class ChaSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'cha'
    allowed_domains = ['thecha.org']
    start_urls = ['http://thecha.org']

    def parse(self, response):
        """
        `parse` should always `yield` a dict that follows the `Open Civic Data
        event standard <http://docs.opencivicdata.org/en/latest/data/event.html>`_.

        Change the `_parse_id`, `_parse_name`, etc methods to fit your scraping
        needs.
        """
        for item in response.css('.eventspage'):
            yield {
                '_type': 'event',
                'id': self._parse_id(item),
                'name': self._parse_name(item),
                'description': self._parse_description(item),
                'classification': self._parse_classification(item),
                'start_time': self._parse_start(item),
                'end_time': self._parse_end(item),
                'all_day': self._parse_all_day(item),
                'status': self._parse_status(item),
                'location': self._parse_location(item),
            }

        # self._parse_next(response) yields more responses to parse if necessary.
        # uncomment to find a "next" url
        # yield self._parse_next(response)

    def _parse_next(self, response):
        """
        Get next page. You must add logic to `next_url` and
        return a scrapy request.
        """
        next_url = None  # What is next URL?
        return scrapy.Request(next_url, callback=self.parse)

    def _parse_id(self, item):
        """
        Calulate ID. ID must be unique within the data source being scraped.
        """
        return None

    def _parse_classification(self, item):
        """
        Parse or generate classification (e.g. town hall).
        """
        return 'Not classified'

    # ...
```

The `ChaSpider.parse(...)` method is a standard part of Scrapy and handles returning data in the correct format and any subsequent requests to be made.

There are pre-defined helper methods for every major field in the data. It's your job to fill them in.

For example, `_parse_classification` could be:

```python
class ChaSpider(scrapy.Spider):

    # ...

    def _parse_classification(self, item):
        """
        Parse or generate classification (e.g. town hall).
        """
        classification = item.css('.classification::text').extract_first()
        return classification

    # ...
```

## Write tests

Our general approach to writing tests is to save a copy of a site's HTML in
`tests/files` and then use that HTML to verify the behavior of each spider. In
this way, we avoid needing a network connection to run tests and our tests
don't break every time a site's content is updated.

Here is the test setup and an example test from the Idph spider:

```python
import pytest

from tests.utils import file_response
from documenters_aggregator.spiders.idph import IdphSpider

test_response = file_response('files/idph.html')
spider = IdphSpider()
parsed_items = [item for item in spider.parse(test_response) if isinstance(item, dict)]


def test_name():
    assert parsed_items[2]['name'] == 'PAC: Maternal Mortality Review Committee Meeting'
```

It is also possible to execute a function over every element in the `parsed_items` list. In the following example, the `test_classification` function will be invoked once for each element in `parsed_items` list.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize('item', parsed_items)
def test_classification(item):
    assert item['classification'] == 'Not classified'
```

Parameterized test functions are best used to assert something about every event such as the existence of a field or a value all events will share.

You can read more about parameterized test functions [in the pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html#pytest-mark-parametrize).

You generally want to verify that a spider:

* Extracts the correct number of events from a page.
* Extracts the correct values from a single event.
* Parses any date and time values, combining them as needed.

## Create a Pull Request

If your ready to submit your code to the project, you should create a pull
request on GitHub. You can do this as early as you would like in order to get
feedback from others working on the project. In this case, please prefix your
pull request name with `WIP` so that everyone knows what kind of feedback you
are looking for.

Additionally, please use the pull request description to explain anything you'd
like a reviewer to know about the code.
