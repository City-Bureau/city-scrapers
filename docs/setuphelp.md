This document covers some of the issues associated with first-time development environment setup and with collaboration using Git.

## Github

### Creating a Github account
If you do not have an account already, go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account.

### Installing Github
Please refer to the [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) according to your operating system to install Git.

### Git 101
For a primer on Git for first-time users, see the [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or watch the [following video on how to (1) find an issue, (2) fork the code, (3) edit code, (4) open a pull request.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLyCZ96_3y5LXfPVZkHjhHRuIWhcjvCyQA&v=m_MjzgvVZ28).

Once you have forked the code and have begun contribution, [syncing your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) periodically with the main City Bureau repository will be useful in staying up-to-date with the project.

1. You must first [add a remote link from which Git can track the main City Bureau project](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/). The remote URL is <https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers.git>. Conventionally we name this remote source `upstream`. The remote source for your original cloned repository is usually named `origin`.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers.git
```
You can see your existing remotes as well by running `git remote -v`.

2. Once you've added the City Bureau remote, fetch the changes from upstream
```
git fetch upstream
```
3. Make sure you are in the branch you hope to merge changes into (typically your `master` branch), then merge the changes in from the `upstream/master` branch. 
```
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```
4. The final step is to update your fork on Github with the changes from the original repository by running `git push`.

## Windows Limitations

This project uses `invoke` tasks, which rely upon the `pty` package for pseudo-terminal utilties. [Unfortunately, `pty` is not available on Windows](https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers/issues/62), which makes it difficult to run all City Scraper tests locally. We recommend that if are using Windows and  want to contribute more extensive code to the project, consider creating a Linux environment by installing a virtual machine, partitioning your computer or following the [Docker installation steps on the install guide](02_installation.md#step-2-option-1-local-python-3-and-virtualenv).

## Creating a virtual environment

The [following gist](https://gist.github.com/bonfirefan/c5556ca54e8bbe9d83764730c36a4b3e) covers common headaches with setting up a virtual environment on a Linux-like environment.

## Getting Google API Credentials

The system has a few scrapers that use the [Google Sheets API]() to pull in
data from manually updated spreadsheets. If you want to run or test these
scrapers, you'll need to get an API key.

If you need an API key for Google Sheets, you can get one for free by:
* Logging into the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis), choosing "Enabled APIs and services", and then searching for "Sheets API", selecting "Google Sheets API", and then clicking "ENABLE".
* Then, in the left sidebar, choose "Credentials" and then "CREATE CREDENTIALS" -> "API Key". You will be shown a key that you can save somewhere safe.

You'll need to set this as an environment variable before running the new scraper. An easy way to do this is to just put it on the command line like so:

```shell
$ DOCUMENTERS_AGGREGATOR_GOOGLE_API_KEY=TheTokenYouCreatedAbove scrapy crawl localschoolcouncil
```
