# Project

The Documenters Aggregator is a collection of webscrapers and utilities to collect and store a comprehensive, central, and accessible calendar for public governmental meetings in Chicago and Cook County.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project: coding a spider (webscraper), building infrastructure, improving documentation, hosting in-person code evenings, and participating in technical discussions in [slack](https://citybureau.slack.com/) about code and design choices.

The best way to familiarize yourself with the code base is to build a spider. Follow the installation and contributing-a-spider sections below to get started. Reach out on [slack](https://citybureau.slack.com/) for support--we can meet up in person to troubleshoot some headaches like virtual environment issues.
