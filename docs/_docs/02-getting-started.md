## Review your state's Open Meetings Act (OMA)

Each state has its own Open Meetings Act. With reasonable exceptions, all public bodies are required to hold meetings open to public and to give adequate notice of when these meetings are held. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with your state's open meetings laws and Ballotpedia's state-by-state [list](https://ballotpedia.org/State_open_meetings_laws) is a great place to start.

## Define your local agency map

We focused our universe of meetings on the local- and county-level, at agencies like the City Council, Board of Education, Police Board, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and the Regional Transportation Authority and their attendant boards, commissions, committees, sub-committees and advisory boards.

- Examples of governmental agencies that typically hold public meetings:

  - City Council
  - Board of Education
  - Police Board

- Types of meeting-holding bodies

  - Boards
  - Commissions
  - Committees
  - Sub-committees
  - Advisory boards

## Templates

Before you start building spiders, organize the information of your relevant agencies in a spreadsheet (you can start from our [downloadable template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1egRcdp5JPnRjk04gvNA-DrGP7TJg01hvPlDPnkjYCa0/edit#gid=1059508700) or see our [example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1egRcdp5JPnRjk04gvNA-DrGP7TJg01hvPlDPnkjYCa0/edit#gid=0)). Because we aimed to create a public-facing tool, we collected information like agency name, meeting-holding body name, jurisdiction, official website, topical tags, contact information and social media handles. As we began coding we added fields to track progress of each scraper.

## Best Practices

Get a sense of how meeting-holding bodies are scheduling public meetings. Do any agencies use a management tool like [Legistar](https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx) or [Municode](https://library.municode.com/il/cook_county) that will be easier to scrape data from? Are any meeting dates stored in formats that are particularly difficult to access, such as in a PDF? If so, call the agency out on it! Given specific, structured feedback on how they could make their calendars more accessible, the public officials we met with were typically willing to do so. What's more, it may save some work on your end.
