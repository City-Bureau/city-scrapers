Public meetings are important spaces for democracy where any resident can participate in civic life and hold public figures accountable. But how does the public know when meetings are happening? It isn't easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.

That's why we worked with a team of civic coders to develop and coordinate the City Scrapers project, an open source community designed to standardize, scrape and share these meetings in a central database, in collaboration with [City Bureau's Documenters program](https://www.documenters.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

Are public governance meetings in your city and county spread across multiple websites? Use our City Scrapers guide to create an open source community project designed to increase access and transparency in your area.
