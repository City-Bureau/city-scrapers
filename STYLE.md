#Style Guide

  This file is a style guide pertaining to the work done in the City Scrapers' repository. The content of this file outlines exactly how to format and document he   code within this project. Please follow these guidelines to ensure that the repository is easily understood and more efficient. These guidelines closely follow     the PEP8 guidelines.

##Comments

  Single line comments should be made using a single # sign. No indentation should be present.

  Multi-line comments should be made using ''' to begin the comment and ''' to end the comment.

##Functions

  Functions should never use complex data types as parameters.
  
  Functions should not have any spacing in the function signature.
  
  Function parameters should never be reassigned.
  
  Functions should be called with the parameter names specified.
  
  Functions should be broken down into digestable blocks, ideally in blocks where all the code pertains to the same thing.

##Naming

  All entities needing a name in the project should be named used relavent names that portray the use or purpose of the entity.
  
  Names should not be single letters.
  
  Names should not be very similar to already existing names.
  
  All variable, function, and instance names should be named using Snake Case, where the first letter of each word is lowercase and words are split up using         underscores.
  
  Classes should be named using Pascal Case where there is no seperation between words and the first letter of each word is capatilized.
  
##Comparison Operators

  Be as concise as possible with boolean operators.
  
  Ternary expressions should not be nested.

##Classes

  Do not use duplicate class members.

##Indentation

  Use only soft tabs for indentation.

  Indent the code within each function using a soft tab.
  
  Indent the code within loops and if statements using a soft tab.
  
##Data Types

  When accessing a primitive type, work on its direct value.
  
  When accessing a complex type, work on its referenced value.

##Whitespace

  Use soft tabs to indent code blocks within a function.
  
  Use spaces around each variable in operators.
  
  Use a single new line at the end of each file.
  
  Use a single new line between each function and block of code.
  
  Do not add spacing anywhere else, including in parethesis, brackets, or code blocks.
